            <p className="text-[14px]">
              <b>ðŸ§ braindumpðŸ’©</b> is an opinionated task tracking tool designed around the process of "braindumping" all the tasks, thoughts, and ideas in your head down in one place.
              It is especially helpful, but not exclusively, for people with ADHD.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[14px]">
              It behaves the same as a typical task tracking tool but is especially helpful for people who find themselves struggling between new tasks and old ones.
              The three primary benefits to ðŸ§ braindumpðŸ’© are: 
            </p>

              <li>Long-term Task Deferral<sup>*</sup></li>
              <li>Annoying Task Reminders<sup>*</sup></li>
            </ol>
            <p className="text-[12px] italic mt-[-10px]"><sup>*</sup> All features are works in progress</p>
            <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
              <h4 className="text-[18px] font-bold">Task Ranking Scores</h4>
              <p className="text-[14px]">
                For those of us who are easily distracted by new & shiny ideas or put off larger tasks until last minute,
                it can be especially difficult to truly see through the mist in identifying which tasks are important to get done.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[14px]">
                By ranking these tasks over time, then comparing to their priority level, we can arrive at a "score" that reflects how
                important this task has been to the user each time they came to re-organize their tasks. 
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
              <h4 className="text-[18px] font-bold">Long-Term Task Deferrals</h4>
              <p className="text-[14px]">
                For creatives, entrepreneurs, and many others the world can be seen as overflowing with new opportunities and ideas.
                Some of these ideas grasp us and bring us to actions, others clutter our pages and apps with what can feel like missed opportunities.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[14px]">
                In ðŸ§ braindumpðŸ’©, tasks that sit too long at a low priority are automatically suggested to be moved to the <i>backlog.</i>
                Users can control these settings, but the idea is to remove faraway ideas from your present tasks and responsibilities.
              </p>

            <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
              <h4 className="text-[18px] font-bold">Annoying Task Reminders</h4>
              <p className="text-[14px]">
                ðŸ§ braindumpðŸ’© is designed to be a bit annoying in the way it handles reminders. 
                While this might not suit everyone, oftentimes people with ADHD or similar brains will allow dealines for important responsibilities
                come and go simply out of procrastination or deference for more interesting tasks.  
              </p>
              <p className="text-[14px]">
                By default, task reminders for the most important tasks are set to be a nuisance. Users may change this in the settings,
                but by insisting upon user action for extremely high-importance task, the hope is to avoid serious consequences for 
                missing the most important tasks.
